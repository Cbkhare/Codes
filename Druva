q.1 Sort a stack. Max one stack of auxiliary space allowed, The only allowed operations in stack are empty(), top(), pop().

q.2 Given a sorted linked list (ascending). Transfer its content to another List. o(n) extra space allowed.
    Constraints:-
    1- Node can be inserted at the end of list.
    2. Data present in the list should be in sorted order(ascending) after each insertion.

Other questions were about finding complexity of given code snippets.
